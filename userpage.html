		Growing hand-made furniture company based outside of High Point, 
				North Carolina. Original owner started about 40 years ago in a basement workshop, 
				building custom-made chests of drawers. Co-owner joined about 30 years ago, 
				after 10-year career with a large furniture retailer. 
				Company has since expanded to 50 full-time craftspeople in a larger local facility. 
				Provides both pre-made and made-to-order furniture. Sells to both in-store customers, 
				retailers, and individuals across the U.S. and internationally. 
				Currently offers hand-made furniture in 3 different general categories; bedroom, living room, and dining room/ kitchen furniture.  
				Many of the sales are from walk-in customers to the store in High Point, NC, 
				but a lot of the company's business depends on the efforts of sales agents who work out of central North Carolina, 
				but who are aggregately responsible for six different general regions.
