			This project has been designed and developed by Minahm Kim, Nathan Egbert, and Andrew Knittle.
		</center>
		The purpose of this project is to test our abilities, and further
		improve our understanding of designing a fully functional website. 
		Here on our website you will be able to select products, how many of these
		products you wish to purchase, and submit this data to be "shipped", but 
		not before you are shown a confirmation page to see if what you put in for
		shipping. This site also supports functionality for different types of users.
		For instance putting in a certain password in the login page will direct
		you to a page designed for either a "manager" or a "sales agent".
		The site also uses a css file to format everything to provide an organized
		and clean look to our website, which should make navigation to 
		various pages simple. As the semester goes on our website will continue 
		to be improved and made more efficient with increased functionality.
